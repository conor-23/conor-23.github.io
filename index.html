<p>Hi, I'm Conor! I'm a computer science PhD student in the <a href="https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/">Sky Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. Much of my current research is part of the Berkeley <a href="https://hydro.run/">Hydro</a> project looking at things like the role of CRDTs in the future of cloud programming. I'm interested in a mix of databases, distributed systems, theory, programming languages, and security, but since databases is a microcosm of computer science we can just call it "databases" for short. </p>
<p>You can find my publications on my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tpxtC84AAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>.</p>
