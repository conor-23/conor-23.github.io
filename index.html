<p>Hi, I'm Conor! I'm a computer science PhD student in the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/">RISE Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. My current research looks at properties we can leverage to better optimize distributed systems in the cloud. I love cross-disciplinary research and this work gives me the chance to use tools from databases, programming languages, distributed systems, and complexity theory. I am equally interested in theoretical foundations and impactful practical implementations of systems.</p>
